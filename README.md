# Zomatoreviewsanalysis
In this project, we performed sentiment analysis on customer reviews from the Zomato dataset using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goals of this project were to understand sentiment analysis, process text data, and classify customer reviews into positive or negative sentiments.

Key Project Steps and Concepts:
1. Data Collection: We started by collecting a dataset of customer reviews from Zomato, which included text data and associated ratings or sentiments provided by customers.
2. Sentiment Analysis in Python: We learned how to perform sentiment analysis in Python, a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text.
3. Text Sentiment Analysis: Text sentiment analysis involves analyzing text data, extracting features, and using machine learning models to classify the sentiment expressed in the text. We used Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK to perform text sentiment analysis.
4. Preprocessing Text Data: To prepare the text data for sentiment analysis, we applied various pre-processing steps, including tokenization, removing stop words, and converting text to numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
5. Sentiment Analysis using Python for Text Data: We used Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to perform sentiment analysis on text data. The model is trained on labeled data, and its accuracy is evaluated on a test dataset. The trained model can also be used to make predictions on new, unseen text data.
6. NLP Sentiment Analysis in Python: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were applied to analyze customer reviews. This included feature extraction, model training, and evaluation of sentiment classification accuracy.
